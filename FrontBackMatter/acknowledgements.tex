\section*{Acknowledgments} % (fold)
I wish to thank Markus Grasmair for helping me with
formulating and solving the problems in this thesis,
and for his excellent feedback on the written work.
%
I also want to thank Mathias Bellout for his guidance
and help with structuring my work during the last
6 months, and Einar Baumann, whose technical input has
saved me more hours than I want to admit. \\
%
Lastly I would like to thank my family and friends 
for supporting me through all these years. I would 
also like to mention that the Pretty Little Liars 
are fabulous. You know who you are.
