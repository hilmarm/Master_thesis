\section*{Preface} % (fold)
%
This thesis was conducted as a part of the 
Master's degree in Physics \& Mathematics
at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at
the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, 
NTNU. 
%
It was written during the spring semester of 
2016 under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Markus 
Grasmair, and co-supervised by Prof. Jon Kleppe
and Postdoc Mathias C. Bellout. The work was
done in close collaboration with the Petroleum 
Cybernetics Group at NTNU.\\

% \hspace{1em}We assume the reader of this report is familiar with reservoir simulation and object-oriented programming and related terminology.
% %
% \hspace{1em}The software developed during this project builds upon and significantly enhances ResOpt, an optimization software package created by Alexander Juell during his Postdoc at the IO Center at NTNU. The work in this project has both enhanced the functionality of and added new features to ResOpt. The code has been restructured to increase efficiency and allow for extensive parallelization; the optimizer interface was completely rewritten, and a pattern search algorithm was added. The main result of this work is that the code is now better organized, more robust and has greater extension and scaling capabilities. Besides an expanded documentation, these changes and additions are the key features we rely on to make the further planned development of FieldOpt more efficient.
% %
% \hspace{1em}We call the new version of the software package FieldOpt. FieldOpt currently comprises more than sixteen thousand lines of C++ source code, of which around four thousand are written from the ground up; the rest originate from ResOptâ€™s source code. The source code for FieldOpt is available in its entirety on GitHub (\url{https://github.com/iocenter/FieldOpt}).
